# Introduction

The Multiplayer Addendum to the Magic Tournament Rules exists to assist Judges who are working at any Rules Enforcement Level in Multiplayer game mode tournaments. This document is written as a supplement to the Magic Tournament Rules and should be used in close conjunction with it. 

This document is an extension of the Magic Tournament Rules, and therefore a person using the Multiplayer Addendum should first be familiar with that document. Once a person has reviewed the relevant sections of the Magic Tournament Rules, they can turn to the Multiplayer Addendum to the Magic Tournament Rules to find details on how to proceed in Multiplayer Tournaments.

## Framework

Each section within this document mirrors its namesake in the Magic Tournament Rules. Within each section, **Policy Additions** and **Edits** can be found. **Policy Additions** are policies outlined as best practice for handling tournaments procedure. **Edits** are designed to address the few important removals or additions to this document that differ from the Magic Tournament Rules. Items or sections with italicized text are taken directly from the Magic Tournament Rules.

At the time of original publishing, this document has been published solely in English. If such a time exists that this document be printed, translated, or otherwise ported to another language, tournament participants must refer to the English version to settle disputes concerning interpretations.

This document is updated periodically. Please obtain the most current version [here](https://juizes-mtg-portugal.github.io/).

# 1. Tournament Fundamentals

## 1.1. Tournament Types

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
  <p>
    There are two types of sanctioned <strong>Magic</strong> tournaments: rated and casual.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rated tournaments are further divided into two types: Premier and non-Premier. Premier tournaments are run by 
    Wizards of the Coast or select Tournament Organizers. They have unique names and features. Non-Premier 
    tournaments are tournaments that are not explicitly Premier.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two major tournament formats: Limited and Constructed. Each has rules specific to its format. In 
    Limited tournaments, all product for play is provided during the tournament. In Constructed tournaments, players 
    compete using decks prepared beforehand. Some Premier tournaments may consist of multiple formats within the 
    same tournament.
  </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**1.1A.** There are two tournament modes: Head-to-Head and Multiplayer. 

In Head-to-Head tournaments, games are played in such a way that there are only two players or two teams involved.

In Multiplayer tournaments, each player or team will play against more than one opposing player or team. The mode of a tournament is a characteristic independent from tournament type and format. A tournament can be, for example, Premier, Limited, and Multiplayer.

In Multiplayer tournaments, players are organized in Pods. A Pod consists of the group of players competing and a seating order.

A Two-Headed Giant team is treated as a single player when determining the tournament mode.

## 1.10 Players
<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Players are responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Behaving in a respectful manner toward tournament officials, other tournament participants, and spectators and refraining from unsporting conduct at all times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintaining a clear and legal game state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complying with announced start times and time limits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Calling attention to any rules or policy infraction they notice in their matches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bringing to a judge’s attention any discrepancies in their tournament match record.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accurately reporting the results of their matches in a timely manner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refraining from enrolling in tournaments in which they are not allowed by policy to participate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being familiar with the rules contained within this document.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being physically present for the tournament. A player must bring the following items to a tournament in order to participate:
      </li>
      <li>
        A physical, visible, and reliable method to maintain and record game information (tokens, score counters, pen and paper, and so on).
      </li>
      <li>
        Any materials specifically required for a particular tournament format, such as assembled decks  and/or decklists for constructed tournaments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Players retain their responsibilities even if a judge provides them with extra assistance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual members of a team are considered players, and are equally responsible for required tournament 
      procedures, such as accurately reporting the results of their match. Players are only responsible for the games they 
      play themselves and not separate games being played by their teammates but are expected to point out rules 
      violations they observe in their teammates’ matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players who do not fulfill their responsibilities may be subject to penalties and review by the DCI. Wizards of the 
      Coast and the DCI reserve the right to suspend or revoke a player's membership without prior notice for any 
      reason they deem necessary.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**1.10A.** For Multiplayer tournaments, if a Player loses a game during a match, they are expected to act as Spectators for the remainder of the ongoing game.

_Example: Alice, Bob, Charles and Dani are playing a Best-of-One Multiplayer match. Bob loses the game to combat damage, but doesn’t leave the table and keeps spectating the game. From this point, until the end of the game, Bob is forbidden from participating in any political or strategic discussions, since at this point it would be advantageous for Bob if the game ended up in a draw._

## 1.12 Rules Enforcement Levels

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Rules Enforcement Levels (REL) are a means to communicate to the players and judges what expectations they can have of the tournament in terms of rigidity of rules enforcement, technically correct play, and procedures used. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rules Enforcement Level of a tournament generally reflects the prizes awarded and the distance a player may be expected to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appropriate Rules Enforcement Level for specific programs is listed in Appendix F. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Regular</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular tournaments are focused on fun and social aspects, not enforcement. Most tournaments are run at this 
      level unless they offer sizeable prizes or invitations. Players are expected to know most of the game rules, may 
      have heard of policy and what is “really bad,” but generally play in a fashion similar to the way they do casually. 
      Players are still responsible for following the rules, but the focus is on education and sportsmanship over 
      technically precise play. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Judging at Regular Rules 
      Enforcement Level document, located at <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-judging-regular-rel">http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-judging-regular-rel</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Competitive</em></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Competitive tournaments are usually those with significant cash prizes or invitations awarded to Professional 
      tournaments. Players are expected to know the game’s rules and be familiar with the policies and procedures, but 
      unintentional errors are not punished severely. These are tournaments that protect the interests of all players by 
      providing tournament integrity while also recognizing that not all players are intimately familiar with 
      Professional-level tournament structure, proper procedures, and rules. Infractions in these tournaments are 
      covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, located at <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide">http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Professional</em></strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Professional level tournaments offer large cash awards, prestige, and other benefits that draw players from great 
      distances. These tournaments hold players to a higher standard of behavior and technically-correct play than 
      Competitive tournaments. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, 
      located at <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide">http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide</a>.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**1.12A.** For Multiplayer tournaments, there are differences on how to handle infractions when compared to Head-to-Head tournaments. Those differences are covered by the Multiplayer Addendum to the Infraction Procedure Guide, located at [https://juizes-mtg-portugal.github.io/](https://juizes-mtg-portugal.github.io/)

# 2. Tournament Mechanics

## 2.1. Match Structure

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      A <strong>Magic</strong> match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a set number of games, usually two. Drawn games do not count toward this goal. If the round ends before a player has won the required number of games, the winner of the match is the player who has won the most games at that point. If both players have equal game wins, the match is a draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tournament Organizer may change the required number of games to be won for any portion of the tournament as long as this choice is announced before the tournament begins. Match results, not individual game results, are reported at the end of the tournament.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.1A.** In Multiplayer tournaments, the usual number of games required to win a match is one. If a game ends in a draw, a new game is started including every player in the Pod.

The winner of a match is the player that won the required number of games, or the player that has won the most games.

In the case of a tie, the match is a draw between the players that participated in that match, with the exception of players that received match loss penalties or players that conceded the match.

_Example: Alice is ranked first in the last round of swiss. This rule prevents her from being targeted by all other Pod participants followed by an intentional draw._

## 2.2. Play/Draw Rule

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      For the first game of a match, a designated player - the winner of a random method (such as a die roll or coin toss) during Swiss rounds, or the player ranked higher at the end of Swiss rounds during playoff matches - chooses either to play first or to play second. They must state this choice before looking at their hand. If they state no choice, it is assumed that they are playing first. The player who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. This is referred to as the play/draw rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each game in a match, the loser of that game decides whether to play first in the next game. They may wait until after sideboarding to make the decision. If the previous game was a draw, the player who decided to play or draw at the beginning of the drawn game chooses.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.2A** In Multiplayer tournaments, both the seating order and first player are defined with a random method. There is no “winner of a random-method” as in Head-to-Head tournaments and therefore no choice to be made in swiss rounds. In single elimination, the player with the highest standing from the swiss portion of the tournament will go first, followed by the player with the next highest, until all player’s order is decided.

**2.2B** For Multiplayer tournaments where the number of game wins required to win a match is  greater than one, the seating order must be randomized across all games. The starting player is decided using a random method for each game after the first.

## 2.3. Pregame Procedure

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The following steps must be performed in a timely manner before each game begins:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If sideboarding is allowed, players may remove cards from their decks and add cards from their sideboards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Players shuffle their decks. Steps 1 and 2 may be repeated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Players present their decks to their opponents for additional shuffling. The sideboard (if any) is also presented at this time.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a companion is being used, it is noted. After the first game, the companion does not need to be noted again; it is assumed to be in use until rescinded.
      </li>
      <li>
        The appropriate player must decide whether to play first or second at this point, if they haven’t done so already (see section 2.2).
      </li>
      <li>
        Each player draws seven cards. Optionally, these cards may be dealt face down on the table.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each player, in turn order, may take mulligans. (Rules on mulligans can be found in the <strong>Magic</strong> Comprehensive Rules, rule 103.4). If a player takes a mulligan, they shuffle again and repeat the presentation process described above.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The game is considered to have begun once all players have completed taking mulligans. Pregame procedures may be performed before time for the match has officially begun.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.3A.** Some Multiplayer tournaments and Formats might introduce changes to the sequence of pregame procedures. Refer to the mode or format specific rules in the Comprehensive Rules.

## 2.4. End of Match Procedure

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Once the game is complete, players may not leave the table until the result of the match is recorded unless they are doing so to record the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the match time limit is reached before a winner is determined, the player whose turn it is finishes their turn and five additional turns are played in total. This usually means that one player takes three turns and the other two, but a player taking extra turns may affect this. If the active player has already indicated that they would like to pass the turn when the time limit is reached, that is considered to be in the next turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Team tournaments featuring multiple players playing together (such as Two-Headed Giant) use three turns instead of five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once time is called, no new games should begin.If the game is incomplete at the end of additional turns, the game is considered a draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a judge assigned a time extension (because of a long ruling, deck check, or other reason) the end-of-match procedure does not begin until the end of the time extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      In single-elimination rounds, matches may not end in a draw. If all players have equal game wins at the end of additional turns, the player with the highest life total wins the current game. In the event all players have equal life totals (or are between games and the game wins are tied), the game/match continues with an additional state-based action: if a player does not have the highest life total, they lose the game. Two-Headed Giant teams are treated as a single player for determining a game winner.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.4A.** In Multiplayer tournaments, organizers have two methods to consider when deciding how to handle end-of-round procedure: 2.4AA and 2.4AB. It is recommended that 2.4AA be utilized when round times are 75 minutes or less, and 2.4AB be utilized when rounds times are between 75 and 90 minutes.

**2.4AA.** In Multiplayer tournaments, use N turns instead of five, where N equals the number of remaining players. The number of extra turns is determined as time in the round is called. Once this number is determined, players leaving the game have no impact. 

_Example: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Daniel are playing in a Multiplayer match. Alice is the active player when time in the round was called. Alice finishes playing turn 0, and since there are 4 remaining players in the Pod, 4 extra turns will be played. Bob takes his turn, then Charlie takes his. However, during Charlie’s turn, Alice and Daniel both lose the game. Bob and Charlie will take the remaining turns, since the number of extra turns was determined as time in the round was called and is not impacted by players leaving the game during extra turns._

**2.4AB.** In Multiplayer tournaments, if the time limit is reached before a winner is determined, the player whose turn it is finishes their turn. If the active player has already indicated that they’d like to pass the turn when the time limit is reached, that is considered to be in the next turn. If the game is incomplete at the end of additional turns, the game is considered a draw. If a judge assigned a time extension (because of a long ruling, deck check, or other reason) the end-of-match procedure does not begin until the end of the time extension. 

_Example: Arnold, Benjamin, Cam, and Durbin are playing in a Multiplayer Match. Arnold is the active player when time in the round is called. Arnold finishes their turn and passes. Since no winner has been declared, the match must be reported as a draw._

**2.4B.** In Multiplayer tournaments, it is strongly recommended that single elimination matches be untimed. Any deviation must be communicated to the players before tournament begins and any tiebreaker method should be based solely on information pertaining to the current match.

## 2.5. Conceding or Intentionally Drawing Games or Matches

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Until the result of a match has been recorded, players may concede or mutually agree to a draw in that game or match. If the conceding player won a game in the match, the match must be reported as 2-1. Intentional draws where no games were played are always reported as 0-0-3 in EventLink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players may not agree to a concession or draw in exchange for any reward or incentive. Doing so will be considered Bribery (see section 5.2).
    </p>
    <p>
      If a player refuses to play, it is assumed that they have conceded the match.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.5A.** In Multiplayer tournaments, players may leave the table after losing a match as remaining players continue playing (see rule 800.4 in the Comprehensive Rules). 

**2.5B.** If a player leaving the game would affect current or imminent game actions, those actions occur as though that player was still in the game until the end of the current phase.

# 3. Tournament Rules

## 3.1. Tiebreakers

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The following tiebreakers are used to determine how a player ranks in a tournament:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Match points
      </li>
      <li>

**3.1A.** In Multiplayer tournaments, the following tie breakers are used to determine how a player ranks:

1. Match points
2. Match Win percentage
3. Opponents’ Average Match points
4. Opponents’ Match Win percentage

## 3.13. Hidden Information

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Hidden information refers to the faces of cards and other objects at which the rules of the game and format do not allow you to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the match, a draft, and pregame procedures, players are responsible for keeping their cards above the level of the playing surface and for making reasonable efforts to prevent hidden information from being revealed. However, players may choose to reveal their hands or any other hidden information available to them, unless specifically prohibited by the rules. Players must not actively attempt to gain information hidden from them but are not required to inform opponents who are accidentally revealing hidden information.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**3.13A** In Head-to-Head tournaments, having the permission to look at an opponent’s card that the opponent can also look at is technically the same as that card being revealed. However in Multiplayer tournaments, that is not true. Being able to look at a card that an opponent can look at doesn’t give a player the right to reveal that card to everyone. According to Head-to-Head Tournament rules though, players are free to reveal cards that they can look at and this clashes with the concept of distinguishing between the Look and Reveal actions as defined in CR 701.16 (a through d). 

One of the reasons we want to allow players revealing hidden information they gained access to is to avoid a player accidentally revealing hidden information and either them or the players that gained that information accidentally being penalized. In Multiplayer it is expected that when a player is dealing with hidden information that pertains to one of their opponents, that they are extra careful about not physically revealing it. At the same time we also want to allow players to still be allowed to bluff about hidden information, so in any situation, players are allowed to verbally reveal any hidden information they may have gained.

In Multiplayer tournaments, the following rules apply to physically revealing card faces in hidden zones:

- Library: the owner of the cards in the library can choose to physically reveal as long as they have been instructed to look at them.
- Face down exile: any player with a currently applicable instruction allowing them to look at the cards may physically reveal them.
- Face down on the battlefield: the controller of the permanent(s) can choose to physically reveal them.
- Face down on the stack: the controller of the spell can choose to physically reveal them.
- Hand: the owner of the card(s) in hand can physically reveal them.
- Any other temporary face down zone: any player with a currently applicable instruction allowing them to look at the cards may physically reveal them.

For the purpose of physically revealing cards, an instruction to look at a card is not transferrable to another player controlling the instructed player.
The choice of physically revealing hidden information belongs to the player as described above, which means that player-controlling effects, won't allow the controller to force the controlled player to physically reveal hidden information.

_Example: Alice resolves a Gitaxian Probe, targeting Bob. Alice may look at Bob’s hand but may not reveal or force Bob to reveal their hand to the remaining players. In this example, Alice is being temporarily shared information about Bob’s hand, and as such she cannot transform the permission granted to her by the Look effect into a Reveal effect. Bob however may choose to reveal their hand at any point._

_Example: Alice resolves a Praetor’s Grasp targeting Bob. Alice may not reveal cards from Bob’s library while resolving the Praetor’s Grasp, neither may Bob. Alice may reveal the chosen card that she exiled face-down. In this example, Bob doesn't know the identity of the cards in their library, and Alice is not the owner of the cards. Also, Alice gained a permission to search Bob's library, not to reveal it, therefore she will be able to only physically reveal the face down exiled card after she chooses one._

_Example: Alice controls an Opposition Agent and is currently controlling Bob while Bob is searching their library. Although Alice can freely talk about cards in Bob's library with the remaining players, Alice cannot physically reveal the cards in Bob’s library to them. In this example, Alice is controlling Bob. However, controlling the player doesn’t grant Alice the right to make out-of-game choices or decisions. The choice to reveal hidden information at any time is granted by MTR 3.13, and as such is not an in-game choice or decision._

_Example: Alice owns a Bane Alley Broker. She activated its ability exiling a Dark Ritual. At some point Bob gains control or Bane Alley Broker and also activates it exiling a Counterspell. Alice can still look at the Dark Ritual but she can no longer reveal it. Bob can also look at Alice's Dark Ritual and he can reveal it. If Charlie now gains control of Bane Alley Broker, both Alice, Bob and Charlie will be able to look at Dark Ritual and Counterspell, but now, only Charlie can physically reveal them._

_Example: Bob is controlling Alice during her turn, due to resolving the activated ability of a Mindslaver. Alice draws an Ad Nauseam for the turn, then Alice casts and resolves Praetor's Grasp targetting Charlie, exiling a Lion's Eye Diamond. Bob has access to all of this hidden information, but Alice still has the choice of physically revealing cards from her hand, and neither Alice or Bob can physically reveal cards from Charlie's library. Alice will also be the one with the choice to physically reveal the Lion's Eye Diamond, not Bob._

_Example: In a situation where Alice resolved Gather Specimens, Bob controls Lens of Clarity and Charlie is resolving a Reality Shift on a creature controlled by David, both Bob and Alice will gain information about the identity of the Manifested card from David entering the battlefield under Alice's control. However this was an object that is owned by David, created by an effect from Charlie, but neither of them have the right to look at. In this situation, Alice is the one deciding if she wants to physically reveal the hidden information regarding the manifested card._

# 4. Communication

## 4.1. Player Communication

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Communication between players is essential to the successful play of any game that involves virtual objects or hidden information. While bluffing may be an aspect of games, there need to be clear lines as to what is, and is not, acceptable for players to say or otherwise represent. This will confirm expectations of both sporting and competitive players during a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      A player should have an advantage due to better understanding of the options provided by the rules of the game, greater awareness of the interactions in the current game state, and superior tactical planning. Players are under no obligation to assist their opponents in playing the game. Regardless of anything else, players are expected to treat opponents politely and with respect. Failure to do so may lead to Unsporting Conduct penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four categories of information: status, free, derived, and private. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      Status information is information that must be announced upon change and physically tracked by the affected player. Methods for tracking must be visible to both players during the match. A shared method is acceptable as long as all players in the match have access to it. At Competitive and Professional REL, methods that can easily be accidentally changed (such as dice) may not be used. Status information consists of:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Life total.
        </li>
        <li>
          Counters a player has attached to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuous effects with no defined expiration within the game that apply to that player, such as Monarchor City’s Blessing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unspent mana in a player’s mana pool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Location in a dungeon.
        </li>
        <li>
          How many times the Ring has tempted a player.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Free information is information to which all players are entitled access without contamination or omissions made by their opponents. If a player is ever unable or unwilling to provide free information to an opponent that has requested it, they should call a judge and explain the situation. Free information consists of:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

## 4.2. Tournament Shortcuts

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      A tournament shortcut is an action taken by players to skip parts of the technical play sequence without explicitly announcing them. Tournament shortcuts are essential for the smooth play of a game, as they allow players to play in a clear fashion without getting bogged down in the minutiae of the rules. Most tournament shortcuts involve skipping one or more priority passes to the mutual understanding of all players; if a player wishes to demonstrate or use a new tournament shortcut entailing any number of priority passes, they must be clear where the game state will end up as part of the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      A player may interrupt a tournament shortcut by explaining how they are deviating from it or at which point in the middle they wish to take an action. A player may interrupt their own shortcut in this manner. If part of the shortcut is discovered to be or becomes illegal, the shortcut stops at that point. A player is not allowed to use a previously undeclared tournament shortcut, or to modify an in-use tournament shortcut without announcing the modification, in order to create ambiguity in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      A player may not request priority and take no action with it. If a player decides they do not wish to do anything, the request is nullified and priority is returned to the player that originally had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the resolution of one of their spells or abilities, a player may not assume their opponent has taken a shortcut. They must seek confirmation that a choice with no visible impact was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain conventional tournament shortcuts used in Magic are detailed below. They define a default communication; if a player wishes to deviate from these, they should be explicit about doing so. Note that some of these are exceptions to the policy above in that they do cause non-explicit priority passes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their first main phase, the non-active player is assumed to be acting in beginning of combat unless they are affecting whether a beginning of combat ability triggers. Then, after those actions resolve or no actions took place, the active player receives priority at the beginning of combat. Beginning of combat triggered abilities (even ones that target) may be announced at this time.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their second main phase or uses a phrase such as “Go” or “Your Turn” at any time, the non-active player is assumed to be acting in the end step unless they are affecting how or whether an end of turn ability triggers. End of turn triggered abilities that do not target resolve after the non-active player passes priority.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whenever a player adds an object to the stack, they are assumed to be passing priority unless theyexplicitly announce that they intend to retain it.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a player adds a group of objects to the stack without explicitly retaining priority, they are assumed to be adding them to the stack individually and allowing each to resolve before adding the next. If another player wishes to take an action at a point in the middle of this sequence, the actions should be reversed to that point.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a player casts a spell or activates an ability and announces choices for it that are not normally made until resolution, the player must adhere to those choices unless an opponent responds to that spell or ability. If an opponent inquires about choices made during resolution, that player is assumed to be passing priority and allowing that spell or ability to resolve. 
      </li> 
      <li>
        A player is assumed to have paid any cost of 0 unless they announce otherwise. 
      </li>
      <li>
        A player who casts a spell or activates an ability that targets an object on the stack is assumed to target the legal spell closest to the top of the stack unless the player specifies otherwise. 
      </li>
      <li>
        A player is assumed to be attacking another player with their creatures and not any planeswalkers that player may control unless the attacking player specifies otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player who does not scry/surveil when instructed to is assumed to have not looked and chosen to leave the cards in the same order.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Two-Headed Giant format, attacking creatures are assumed to be attacking the head of the defending player sitting directly across from their controller, unless the creature's controller specifies otherwise.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Edits**

Any references to “non-active player” within MTR 4.2 refer to each non-active player in turn order within Multiplayer tournaments.

The following shortcut doesn't apply in Multiplayer tournament games, as long as there are more than 2 players still participating in said game:

* _A player is assumed to be attacking another player with their creatures and not any planeswalkers that player may control unless the attacking player specifies otherwise._

The reason being that we can't simply assume a default opponent when there are multiple options. Players will always need to define an opponent / planeswalker / battle when attacking. This also applies to creatures put directly into the battlefield and attacking.

**Policy Additions**

**4.2A** In Multiplayer tournaments, if a player requests priority and decides they do not wish to do anything, the request is nullified, priority is returned to the active player and the game state is backed up to the point after the last game action.

This is in contrast to Head-to-Head tournaments, where the priority is returned to the player that had originally it. This is done to prevent abuse where players verbally announce outside of their priority window, that they wish to do something and by not doing anything, they are potentially leading other players into passing priority.

_Example: Alice is attacking and Bob is pondering what to do while they have priority. Daniel says they will use a Cyclonic Rift at the end of Alice’s turn. Thus, Bob passes priority and Charles also passes priority, followed by Daniel. Combat ends and during their second main phase, Alice plays a land and says “Pass the turn” - attempting to execute the Tournament Shortcut. Then, Bob and Charles both pass priority saying “OK “ on the Tournament Shortcut, knowing that Daniel would do something. However, Daniel says he changed his mind and doesn’t want to do anything._

_If Daniel were to pass priority here, the turn would end and Bob’s turn would start, without Bob having a chance to do anything._

_The Head-to-Head fix would allow Charles to have priority at this point, but Charles is fully tapped-out, so they can’t initiate a new round of priority._

_With this fix, we allow Alice to have priority back in their second main phase, after they played the land for the turn._

## 4.4. Loops

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      A loop is a form of tournament shortcut that involves detailing a sequence of actions to be repeated and then performing a number of iterations of that sequence. The loop actions must be identical in each iteration and cannot include conditional actions ("If this, then that".)
    </p>
    <p>
      If no players are involved in maintaining the loop, each player in turn order chooses a number of iterations to perform before they will take an action to break the loop or that they wish to take no action. If all players choose to take no action, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number takes an action to break the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one player is involved in maintaining the loop, they choose a number of iterations. The other players, in turn order, agree to that number or announce a lower number after which they intend to intervene. The game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority.
    </p>
    <p>
      If two or more players are involved in maintaining a loop within a turn, each player in turn order chooses a number of iterations to perform. The game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loops may span multiple turns if a game state is not meaningfully changing. Note that drawing cards other than the ones being used to sustain the loop is a meaningful change. If two or more players are involved in maintaining a loop across turns, each player chooses a number of iterations to perform, or announces their intent to continue indefinitely. If all players choose to continue indefinitely, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority at the point they stop taking an action to sustain the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A player intervening during a loop may specify that one iteration of the loop is only partly performed in order to be able to take action at the appropriate point. If they do, the final iteration is only performed up to the chosen point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-deterministic loops (loops that rely on decision trees, probability, or mathematical convergence) may not be shortcut. A player attempting to execute a nondeterministic loop must stop if at any point during the process a previous game state (or one identical in all relevant ways) is reached again. This happens most often in loops that involve shuffling a library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some loops are sustained by choices rather than actions. In these cases, the rules above may be applied, with the player making a different choice rather than ceasing to take an action. The game moves to the point where the player makes that choice. If the choice involves hidden information, a judge may be needed to determine whether any choice is available that will not continue the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge is the final arbiter of what constitutes a loop. A player may not 'opt-out' of shortcutting a loop, nor may they make irrelevant changes between iterations in an attempt to make it appear as though there is no loop. Once a loop has been shortcut, it may not be restarted until the game has changed in a relevant way. Proposing loops as an effort to use up time on the clock is Stalling.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**4.4A** In Multiplayer tournaments, a player intervening during a loop may specify that one iteration of the loop is only partly performed in order to be able to take action at the appropriate point. If they do, the final iteration is only performed up to the chosen point. This process cycles through each player, in turn order, where they may propose a number of iterations and point in the loop where they wish to interrupt.

This process continues until an earliest point in the loop is not proposed, in which case it's considered that everyone is passing priority on the loop until it reaches the agreed point.

Then, the first player that proposed the earliest point in the loop is considered to be requesting priority to interrupt the shortcut created by the loop.

This process follows the same rules specified in MAMTR 4.2A.

# 5. Tournament Violations

## 5.4. Unsporting Conduct

**Policy Additions**

Unsporting conduct will not be tolerated at any time. Tournament participants must behave in a polite and respectful manner. Unsporting conduct includes, but is not limited to: 

* ... _(existing items)_
* Violating the Tournament Organizer’s Code of Conduct (if applicable).

# 6. Constructed Tournament Rules

## 6.1. Deck Construction Restrictions 

**Policy Additions**

**6.1A.** Some formats have different deck construction restrictions defined in the Comprehensive Rules beginning in section 900.

## 6.*. Commander Format Deck Construction

**This section as whole is an addition from this supplement and should be interpreted as being under the “6. Constructed Tournament Rules” section of the Magic Tournament Rules: After “6.7. Pioneer Format Deck Construction”.**

Commander Format introduces changes to the Deck Construction rules as defined in section 903.5 of the Comprehensive Rules.

Refer to the official banlist available at: [https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/banned-list/](https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/banned-list/)

# *. Commander Tournament Rules

**This section as whole is an addition from this supplement and should be interpreted as being next to the Format-specific sections of the Magic Tournament Rules: After “9. Two-Headed-Giant Tournament Rules” and before “10. Sanctioning Rules”.**

## *.1. Match Structure

***.1A.** In Commander matches, the required number of game wins to win a match is one. As per 2.1, a Match continues until the required number of game wins is attained by a player or ends in a draw.

***.1B.** In Commander matches, players play against each other in Pods. Each Pod should be composed of four players. In the case that the number of participants is not divisible by 4, it is recommended that players that can’t be matched in Pods of four receive a Bye for that round instead.

## *.2. Communication Rules

***.2A.** Commander Damage is considered Status Information and therefore subject to the rules defined in section 4.1 Player Communication.

## *.3. Play/Draw Rule

***.3A.** Due to Commander being typically played in Best-of-One matches, the way the turn cycles are organized in the Pod, and the fact that the first player also draws, the Play-Draw Rule is ignored.

Instead, for the Swiss portion of the tournament, seating order (and thus turn order) will be established by a random method decided by the Tournament Organizer. The turn order cannot be altered except by in-game effects.

For the single elimination portion of the tournament, the seating and play order is defined by the standings from the Swiss portion of the tournament, in accordance with rule 2.2A Play/Draw Rule.

***.3B.** If the tournament match structure includes multiple games per match, it is recommended that the seating order is randomized between games, as well as the starting player, because otherwise all the players would continue playing with the same priority order as before.

## *.4. Pregame Procedure

***.4A.** Before drawing opening hands, players will reveal their Companion (if any) and then their Commander as per Comprehensive Rules 103.2c. All other pregame procedures are performed as normal.

## *.5. Time Extensions

***.5A** Because Commander decks are 100-card singleton lists, after a Deck Check is performed tournament staff should award extra time to the affected match totaling the time spent on the deck check, plus four (4) extra minutes to account for the additional shuffling time needed.

## *.6. Commander Booster Draft

***.6A** Refer to the Comprehensive Rules (section 903.13. Commander Draft) for instructions on how Commander Booster Draft works.

## *.7 Commander Single Elimination Procedures

***.7A** Due to the nature of Commander gameplay, it is strongly recommended that single-elimination rounds be run with no time limit. Any deviation from this recommendation must be communicated to the players before tournament begins and any tiebreaker method should be based solely on information pertaining to the current match.

# 10. Sanctioning Rules

## 10.1 Participation Minimums

**Policy Additions**

**10.1A.** For Multiplayer tournaments at Regular Rules Enforcement Level, a minimum of four (4) players must participate.

**10.1B.** For Multiplayer tournaments at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, a minimum of sixteen (16) players must participate.

## 10.2 Number of Rounds

**Policy Additions**

**10.2A.** For Multiplayer tournaments at Regular Rules Enforcement Level, a minimum of one (1) round should be played.

**10.2B.** For Multiplayer tournaments at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, a minimum of two (2) rounds should be played.

## 10.4 Pairing Algorithm 

**10.4A.** For Multiplayer tournaments, it is recommended that Tournament Organizers use Squirebot. The most up-to-date version can be found at (https://github.com/MonarchDevelopment/SquireCore/tree/main/docs/SwissPairingAlgorithm.md)

In Multiplayer tournaments, the modified swiss pairing algorithm is as follows:

* Pairings should be done by sorting players by performance (Match points plus Tiebreakers in order), followed by preferably matching players following the performance order, starting from the highest performing players, by allocating them to Pods. This is referred to as Top-to-Bottom assignment.
* This matching process must avoid matching between players that have already played against each other during previous rounds.
* In the case where Players cannot receive any match during the first Top-to-Bottom pass, the process should iteratively attempt to swap the unmatched players with players that can fit into the incomplete Pods (typically the last pods of the tournament, since the first pass happened in a Top-to-Bottom fashion). The swapped players will then become "Paired up" or "Paired down" depending if they ended in a highest rated pod or not.
* In competitive REL events, Byes should be awarded to lowest rated players in the case the division of the total number of participants by the number of Pods has a remainder greater than zero. 
  - _Note: The reasoning behind this is to avoid tainting the competitive spirit of the event by presenting a random situation to the players where their deck, prepared to play in a pod of 4, all of a sudden is paired up to a pod of 3_ 
* In regular REL events, instead of awarding Byes in case of an uneven distribution of players through the pods, players should be instead matched into one ore more pods of smaller size, always trying to minimize the difference in pod size towards the norm. Examples:
  - _In an event with 23 players, pair players using 5 pods with size 4 and 1 pod with size 3_
  - _In an event with 22 players, pair players using 4 pods with size 4 and 2 pods with size 3_
  - _In an event with 21 players, pair players using 3 pods with size 4 and 3 pods with size 3_

In Multiplayer tournaments, the single-elimination playoffs are paired according to the following pattern:

![Screenshot 2022-05-30 124751](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5087/170986132-35236b8f-97bb-4240-97b0-a5ef77a79a4e.png)

Uneven cuts:

- In the case of a top 40 cut, the top 8 seeded players skip the quarterfinals, with the remaining 32 players being paired in 8 Pods for the quarterfinals, according to the pattern above. 
- In the case of a top 10 cut, the top 2 seeded players skip the semifinals, with the remaining 8 players being paired in 2 pods for the semifinals, according to the pattern above.

In the semi finals, the seeds of the winners from the quarterfinals are taken into account and the same pattern as above is applied for the semi final pairings.

# Appendix B – Time Limits

**Policy Additions**

* For Multiplayer tournaments at Regular REL—90 minutes
* For Multiplayer tournaments at Competitive REL—75 minutes
* For Multiplayer single elimination matches—no time limit

# Appendix C – Tiebreaker Explanation

## Match Points

**Policy Additions**

In Multiplayer tournaments, players earn N+1 match points for each match win, where N is the standard number of players in a Pod for that tournament.

The winner is the one that by the end of the round time has the most game wins or that before the end of the round time has achieved the required number of game wins.

In the case of a tie, all players in the pod are awarded 1 match point, including players that have fewer game points than the ones tied with most game points. Beware of the exceptions to this in rule 2.1. Match Structure (penalties and concessions).

Players that lost the match are awarded 0 points.

In Best-of-One matches, the match points coincide with game points.

A player who receives a bye in a Multiplayer tournament receives N+1 match points, where N is the standard number of players in a Pod for that tournament.

## Game Points

**Policy Additions**

In Multiplayer tournaments, players earn N+1 game points for each game they win, where N is the standard number of players in a Pod for that tournament.

Each player who began a game that does not end with a winner being declared will earn 1 point.

## Match-Win Percentage

**Policy Additions**

In Multiplayer tournaments, the Match Win Percentage is defined as follows:

$$ {\text{Match points} - (\text{Number of byes} \times \text{Points per win}) \over \text{Number of matches played} \times \text{Points per win}} $$

## Opponents’ Average Match Points

**Policy Additions**

In Multiplayer tournaments, Opponents’ Average Match Points is defined as follows:

$$ {\text{(MP  of opponent 1)} + \text{(MP of opponent 2)} + \text{...} + \text{(MP of opponent n)} \over n} $$

Note that Byes do not count towards n.

## Opponents’ Match-Win Percentage

**Policy Additions**

In Multiplayer tournaments, Opponent Match Win % is defined as follows: 

$$ {\text{(MW Percent of opponent 1)} + \text{(MW Percent of opponent 2)} + \text{...} + \text{(MW Percent of opponent n)} \over n} $$

When using the MW% of an opponent in the formula above, we don't minimum-cap it to 0.33 when compared to Head-to-head tournaments.

Instead, the minimum-cap is defined by:

{% raw %}
$$
{1 \over \text{Points per win}}
$$
{% endraw %}

# Appendix E – Recommended Number of Rounds in Swiss Tournaments

**Policy Additions**

For Multiplayer tournaments, in a configuration of four (4) players per Pod, it is recommended to use the following number of rounds:

| Players | Swiss Rounds                                                     | Playoff |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 4       | None (Run 1 Single elimination round)                            | None    |
| 5-15    | 2                                                                | Top 4   |
| 16-32   | 3                                                                | Top 10  |
| 33-64   | 4                                                                | Top 16  |
| 65-128  | 5                                                                | Top 16  |
| 129-256 | 5                                                                | Top 40  |

For Multiplayer tournaments with more than 257 participants, perform a Top 40 Playoff and apply the following mathematical formula to figure out the number of rounds to play:

$$ {\text{Rounded up }(\log_4(\text{number of players})) + 1} $$

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5087/215114736-5f1488d8-2927-4845-a9dc-20201aaa1250.png)

_Between 257 and 1024 players, the recommended number of rounds is 6._

_With 1024+ players the recommended number of rounds becomes 7._

_In any case, you may want to consider splitting very large events into smaller ones that get merged afterwards_ 

When the number of players is uneven with the desired Pod size, and byes are being awarded, consider that for each player being awarded a Bye, it's as if 3 invisible players would also exist. Think of these invisible players as dummies that the player awarded the Bye got to play against and win. So, in a scenario where you have 30 players enrolled in the event, because you will have to award 2 Byes, you should actually consider using a number of rounds as if you had 36 players, to mitigate the power imbalance of the multiple Byes.
