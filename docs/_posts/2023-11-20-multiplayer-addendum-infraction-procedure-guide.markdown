# Introduction

The Multiplayer Addendum to the Infraction Procedure Guide exists to assist Judges who are working at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level in Multiplayer Game Mode Tournaments. This document is written as a supplement to the Infraction Procedure Guide and should be used in close conjunction with it and the Multiplayer Addendum to the Magic Tournament Rules. 

This document is an extension of the Infraction Procedure Guide, and therefore a person using the Multiplayer Addendum should first be familiar with that document. Once a person has reviewed the relevant sections of the Infraction Procedure Guide, they can turn to the Multiplayer Addendum to the Infraction Procedure Guide to find details on how to proceed in Multiplayer Tournaments.

## Framework

Each section within this document mirrors its namesake in the Infraction Procedure Guide. Within each section, **Policy Additions** can be found. **Policy Additions** are policies outlined as best practice for handling infractions, penalties, and fixes.

See the **Multiplayer Addendum to the Tournament Rules** for further definitions of terms in this document. 

At the time of original publishing, this document has been published solely in English. If such a time exists that this document be printed, translated, or otherwise ported to another language, tournament participants must refer to the English version to settle disputes concerning interpretations.

This document is updated periodically. Please obtain the most current version [here](https://juizes-mtg-portugal.github.io/).

# 1. General Philosophy

## 1.1. Definition of Penalties

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
<strong>Warning</strong>
</p>
<p>
Warnings are used in situations of incorrect play when a small amount of time is needed to 
implement the corrective procedure. The purpose of a Warning is to alert judges and players 
involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a permanent record of the infraction. A time 
extension should be issued if the ruling has taken more than a minute.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Game Loss</strong>
</p>
<p>
A Game Loss ends the current game immediately and the player who committed the infraction is 
considered to have lost the game for the purpose of match reporting. The player receiving a 
Game Loss chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of that match, if applicable. If a 
Game Loss is issued before the match begins, neither player in that match may use sideboards (if 
the tournament uses them) for the first game they play. 
</p>
<p>
Game Losses are applied immediately if the game is still ongoing, or to the player’s next game if 
it is not, unless otherwise specified. If a player would receive multiple Game Losses at the same 
time, they only receive one. If simultaneous Game Loss penalties are issued to each player, they 
are recorded, but do not affect the match score. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Match Loss</strong>
</p>
<p>
A Match Loss is a severe penalty that is usually issued when the match itself has been 
compromised. 
</p>
<p>
Match Losses are applied to the match during which the offense occurred unless the offender’s 
match has already ended, in which case the penalty will be applied to that player’s next match. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disqualification</strong>
</p>
<p>
A Disqualification is issued for activity that damages the integrity of a tournament as a whole or 
for severe unsporting conduct. 
</p>
<p>
The recipient of a Disqualification does not need to be a player in the tournament. They may be a 
spectator or other bystander. 
</p>
<p>
Disqualification can occur without proof of action so long as the Head Judge determines 
sufficient information exists to believe the tournament’s integrity may have been compromised. 
It is recommended that the Head Judge’s report reflect this fact.
</p>
<p>
When this penalty is applied, the player loses their current match and is dropped from the 
tournament. If a player has already received prizes at the time they are disqualified, that player 
may keep those prizes but does not receive any additional prizes or awards they may be due. 
</p>
<p>
When a player is disqualified during a tournament, they are removed from the tournament and do 
not take up a place in the standings. This means that all players in the tournament will advance 
one spot in the standings and are entitled to any prizes the new standing would offer. If the 
Disqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional players advance in place of the 
disqualified player although they do move up a spot in the standings. For example, if a player is 
disqualified during the quarterfinal round of a Magic Tabletop Mythic Qualifier, the former 9th 
place finisher does not advance into the single elimination top 8, but they do move into 8th place 
in the standings. 
</p>
<p>
Disqualifications should be reported <a href="https://askwpn-na.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001446253">here</a>. Please include the Wizards Account email address of 
the disqualified player and that player’s opponent.
    </p>

**Policy Additions**

**1.1A.** In Multiplayer Tournaments, in some cases the penalty or additional remedy of **Skipping a Turn** is applied. Please refer to the Comprehensive Rules 500.10 for details on how Skipping a Turn works.

**1.1B.** In Multiplayer Tournaments that use a Best-of-One match structure, a new penalty is introduced: 

**Skip Priority**

The Skip Priority penalty applies for Multiplayer Tournaments, at Competitive and Professional REL, in Best of One Matches:

- The Penalty consists in the player Passing Priority on every action until the end of their next turn.
- The player will still put triggered abilities on the stack, chose targets for them, and resolve them.
- The player will be able to pay costs (such as when resolving triggers from Remora, Pact of Negation, Mana Vault, Rhystic Study).
- The player will be allowed to declare blockers.
- The player will only be allowed to declare mandatory attackers (such as creatures that must attack).
- The player will not be allowed to play a land.
- The player will not be allowed to cast a spell by normal means (but they can if they are resolving a triggered ability, like Rebound or Suspend).
- The player will not be allowed to activate abilities (except mana abilities to pay for costs).

## 1.3. Randomizing a Library

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
The remedy for some infractions in this document includes shuffling the randomized portion of 
the library. This requires first determining whether any portion of the library is non-random, such 
as cards that have been manipulated on the top or bottom of the library, and separating those. 
Check with both players to verify this, and check the graveyard, exile, and battlefield for library 
manipulation cards, such as Brainstorm and cards with the scry mechanic. Once the library has 
been shuffled, any manipulated cards are returned to their correct locations.
</p>
<p>
Shuffles performed by a judge as part of a remedy are not considered shuffles for game purposes.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**1.3A.** In Multiplayer Tournaments, **check with all Players** when determining and verifying wheter any portion of a library is non-random.

# 2. Game Play Errors

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
Game Play Errors are caused by incorrect or inaccurate play of the game such that it results in 
violations of the <strong>Magic</strong> Comprehensive Rules. Many offenses fit into this category and it would 
be impossible to list them all. The guide below is designed to give judges a framework for 
assessing how to handle a Game Play Error.
</p>
<p>
Most Game Play Error infractions are assumed to have been committed unintentionally. If the 
judge believes that the error was intentional, they should first consider whether an Unsporting 
Conduct — Cheating infraction has occurred. 
</p>
<p>
With the exception of Failure to Maintain Game State, which is never upgraded, the third or 
subsequent Warning for a Game Play Error offense in the same category is upgraded to a Game 
Loss. For multi-day tournaments, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2A.** In Multiplayer Tournaments, given the **added complexity of the game state** that can occur, specially in **Best-of-One matches**, the third infraction is often not worthy of an upgrade from **Warning** to **Game Loss** which is an effective **Match Loss**. It is still important, however, to discourage the infraction and mitigate the possible gained avantage. 

As such, in Multiplayer Tournaments, the **fourth and fifth Warnings** for a Game Play Error in the same category, are upgraded to a **Skip Priority** penalty. The **sixth and subsequent Warnings** for a Game Play Error in the same category, are upgraded to a **Game Loss**.

## 2.1. Game Play Error — Missed Trigger

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">No Penalty</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A triggered ability triggers, but the player controlling the ability doesn’t demonstrate awareness 
      of the trigger’s existence by the first time that it would affect the game in a visible fashion.
      The point by which the player needs to demonstrate this awareness depends on the impact that 
      the trigger would have on the game:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that requires its controller to choose targets (other than 'target opponent'), modes, or other choices made when the ability is put onto the stack</strong>: The controller must announce those choices before they next pass priority.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that causes a change in the visible game state (including life 
        totals) or requires a choice upon resolution</strong>: The controller must take the appropriate 
        physical action or acknowledge the specific trigger before taking any game actions (such 
        as casting a sorcery spell or explicitly taking an action in the next step or phase) that can 
        be taken only after the triggered ability should have resolved. Note that passing priority, 
        casting an instant spell or activating an ability doesn’t mean a triggered ability has been 
        forgotten, as it could still be on the stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that changes the rules of the game</strong>: The controller must 
        acknowledge the trigger or stop an opponent who tries to take any resulting illegal action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways</strong>: The controller 
        must make the change known by the first time the change has an effect on the visible 
        game state.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once any of the above obligations has been fulfilled, further problems are treated as a Game Play 
      Error — Game Rule Violation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triggered abilities that do nothing except create delayed triggered abilities automatically resolve 
      without requiring acknowledgment. Awareness of the resulting delayed trigger must be 
      demonstrated at the appropriate point. Triggered abilities that do nothing except create one or 
      more copies of a spell or ability (such as storm or cipher) automatically resolve, but awareness of 
      the resulting objects must be demonstrated using the same requirements as described above 
      (even though the objects may not be triggered abilities).
    </p>
    <p>
      Abilities consisting of an action followed by “when you do” in the same ability are considered 
      communicated by the announcement of the action. This is most commonly the case for exert and 
      similar abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a triggered ability would have no impact on the game, it’s not an infraction to fail to 
      demonstrate awareness of it. For example, if the effect of a triggered ability instructs its 
      controller to sacrifice a creature, a player who controls no creatures isn’t required to demonstrate 
      awareness of the ability. Similarly, a player demonstrating awareness of an optional trigger with 
      no visible effect is assumed to have made the affirmative choice unless the opponent responds.
      Judges do not intervene in a missed trigger situation unless they intend to issue a Warning or 
      have reason to suspect that the controller is intentionally missing their triggered abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      A player controlling another player is responsible for that player’s triggers in addition to their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        Knight of Infamy (a 2/1 creature with exalted) attacks alone. Its controller says “Take 
        two.”
      </li>
      <li>
        A player forgets to remove the final time counter from a suspended spell and then draws 
        a card during their draw step.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player casts Manic Vandal, then forgets its triggered ability by not choosing a target for 
        it. They realize this only after casting another spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player forgets to exile the Angel token created by Geist of Saint Traft at end of combat. 
        They realize the error when declaring blockers during the next turn.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be harshly penalized when 
      forgetting about one. Players are expected to remember their own triggered abilities; 
      intentionally ignoring one may be Unsporting Conduct — Cheating (unless the ability would 
      have no impact on the game as described above). Even if an opponent is involved in the 
      announcement or resolution of the ability, the controller is still responsible for ensuring the 
      opponents make the appropriate choices and take the appropriate actions. Opponents are not 
      required to point out triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may do so if they 
      wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise indicated, and the impact on 
      the game state may not be immediately apparent. The opponent’s benefit is in not having to point 
      out triggered abilities, although this does not mean that they can cause triggers to be missed. If 
      an opponent requires information about the precise timing of a triggered ability or needs details 
      about a game object that may be affected by a resolved triggered ability, that player may need to 
      acknowledge that ability’s existence before its controller does. A player who makes a play that 
      may or may not be legal depending on whether an opponent’s uncommunicated trigger has been 
      remembered has not committed an infraction; their play either succeeds, confirming that the 
      trigger has been missed, or is rewound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to be missed by taking game 
      actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game. During an opponent’s turn, if a trigger’s 
      controller demonstrates awareness of the trigger before they take an active role (such as taking 
      an action or explicitly passing priority), the trigger is remembered. The Out-of-Order Sequencing 
      rules (MTR section 4.3) may also be applicable, especially as they relate to batches of actions or 
      resolving items on the stack in an improper order.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the triggered ability is an enters-the-battlefield trigger of an Aura that affects only the 
      enchanted permanent and causes a visible change to that permanent, resolve the ability 
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the triggered ability is a delayed triggered ability that undoes a zone change (including token 
      creation) caused by the effect that created the delayed triggered ability, the opponent chooses 
      whether to resolve the ability the next time a player would get priority or when a player would 
      get priority at the start of the next phase. The new zone does not need to be the same as the one 
      the card was originally moved from.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all other triggered abilities, if the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous 
      turn, instruct the players to continue playing. If the triggered ability created an effect whose 
      duration has already expired, instruct the players to continue playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the triggered ability isn’t covered by the previous paragraphs, the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack. If it is, it’s inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if possible or on the bottom of the stack. No player may make choices for the triggered ability involving objects that would not have been legal choices when the ability should have triggered. For example, if the ability instructs a player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the player is in the process of, or has just completed, an action that indicates the trigger has 
      been missed, and completing that action would change the effect of the trigger, a simple backup 
      may be performed on that action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Upgrade:</strong> If the triggered ability is usually considered detrimental for the controlling player and 
      they own the card responsible for the existence of the trigger, the penalty is a Warning. The 
      current game state is not a factor in determining this, though symmetrical abilities (such as 
      Howling Mine) may be considered usually detrimental or not depending on who is being 
      affected.

**Policy Additions**

**2.1A. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, since there are multiple opponents, **the decisions** that would be made by "the opponent" _(when and if the missed trigger is put on the stack / resolves)_, are **instead made by a majority vote** of the opponents. If no majority decision is reached _(perhaps because one opponent was eliminated and there is an even number of opponents)_, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent.

**2.1A. Note** In Multiplayer Tournaments, Judges and Players must be on the lookout for situations where the Player that committed the infraction is benefiting from the opponent's decision, which in some corner cases can be a sign of collusion and / or cheating. Keep in mind that given the nuances of multiplayer, sometimes opponents will legitimately choose an option that benefits the Player that committed the infraction.

## 2.3. Game Play Error — Hidden Card Error

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Warning</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
A player commits an error in the game that cannot be corrected by only publicly available 
information. It is not a Hidden Card Error if the opponent acknowledges the action or controls 
the continuous effect modifying the game rule that made the action illegal. This infraction only 
applies when a card whose identity is known to only one player is in a hidden set of cards both 
before and after the error.
    </p>
    <p>
If an additional card is seen but not added to the set, the infraction is Game Play Error —
Looking at Extra Cards.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        A player draws four cards after casting Ancestral Recall.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player scries two cards when they should only have scried one.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player resolves a Dark Confidant trigger, but forgets to reveal the card before putting it into their hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player has more cards in their hand than can be accounted for.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player casts Anticipate and picks up the top four cards of their library.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player, going first, draws for their turn.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
Though the game state cannot be reversed to the ‘correct’ state, this error can be mitigated by 
giving the opponent sufficient knowledge and ability to offset the error so that it is less likely to 
generate advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
If cards are placed into a public zone, then their order is known and the infraction can be handled 
as a Game Rule Violation. Order cannot be determined from card faces only visible to one player 
unless the card is in a uniquely identifiable position (such as on top of the library, or as the only 
card in hand.)
    </p>
    <p>
Be careful not to apply this infraction in situations where a publicly-correctable error 
subsequently leads to an uncorrectable situation such as a Brainstorm cast using green mana. In 
these situations, the infraction is based on that root cause.
    </p>
    <p>
Information about cards previously known by the opponent, such as cards previously revealed 
while on the top of the library or by a previous look at the hand, may be taken into account while 
determining the set of cards to which the remedy applies.
    </p>
    <p>
Always operate on the smallest set possible to remedy the error. This may mean applying the 
remedy to only part of a set defined by an instruction. For example, if a player resolves Collected 
Company, picks up three cards with one hand and then four cards with the other, the last drawn 
set of four cards should be used for the remedy, instead of the full set of seven cards.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
In cases where the infraction was immediately followed by moving a card from the affected set 
to a known location, such as by discarding, putting cards on top of the library, or playing a land, 
a simple backup to the point just after the error may be performed.
    </p>
    <p>
If the set of cards that contained the problem no longer exists, there is no remedy to be applied.
    </p>
    <p>
If the error put cards into a set prematurely and other operations involving cards in the set should 
have been performed first, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and their
opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards. Put those cards aside until the point at 
which they should have been legally added, then return them to the set.
    </p>
    <p>
If the error involves one or more cards that were supposed to be revealed, the player reveals the 
set of cards that contains the unrevealed cards and their opponent chooses that many previously-unknown cards. Treat those as the cards that were ‘revealed’ and return them to the set that was 
being selected from; the player then reperforms the action. If recreating the original selection set 
and reperforming the action would be too disruptive, leave the selected cards in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
If a set affected by the error contains more cards than it is supposed to contain, the player reveals 
the set of cards that contains the excess and their opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards sufficient to reduce the set to the correct size. These excess cards are returned to 
the correct location. If that location is the library, they should be shuffled into the random portion
unless the owner previously knew the identity of the card/cards illegally moved; that many cards, 
chosen by the opponent, are returned to the original location instead. For example, if a player 
playing with Sphinx of Jwar Isle illegally draws a card, that card should be returned to the top of 
the library.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Upgrade</strong>: If a face-down card cast using a morph ability is discovered during the game to not 
have a morph ability, the penalty is a Game Loss. If the player has one or more cards with a 
morph ability in hand, has not added previously unknown cards to their hand since casting the 
card found in violation, and has discovered the error themselves, the upgrade does not apply and 
they may swap the card for a card with the morph ability in hand.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.3A Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, the **decision on what cards** must be returned is made by a **majority vote** of opponents. If no majority decision is reached, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent.

**2.3A. Note** In Multiplayer Tournaments, Judges and Players must be on the lookout for situations where the Player that committed the infraction is benefiting from the opponent's decision, which in some corner cases can be a sign of collusion and / or cheating. Keep in mind that given the nuances of multiplayer, sometimes opponents will legitimately choose an option that benefits the Player that committed the infraction.

## 2.5. Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Warning</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
This infraction covers the majority of game situations in which a player makes an error or fails to 
follow a game procedure correctly. It handles violations of the Comprehensive Rules that are not 
covered by the other Game Play Errors. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        A player casts Wrath of God for 3W (actual cost 2WW).
      </li>
      <li>
        A player does not attack with a creature that must attack each turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player fails to put a creature with lethal damage into a graveyard and it is not noticed until several turns later.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Phyrexian Revoker is on the battlefield that should have had a card named for it.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player casts Brainstorm and forgets to put two cards back on top of their library.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
While Game Rule Violations can be attributed to one player, they usually occur publicly and 
both players are expected to be mindful of what is happening in the game. It is tempting to try 
and “fix” these errors, but it is important that they be handled consistently, regardless of their 
impact on the game. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
First, consider a simple backup (see section 1.4).
    </p>
    <p>
If a simple backup is not sufficient and the infraction falls into one or more of the following 
categories, and only into those categories, perform the appropriate partial fix:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a player forgot to untap one or more permanents at the start of their turn and it is still the same turn, untap them.</li> 
      <li>If a player made an illegal choice (including no choice where required) for a static ability generating a continuous effect still on the battlefield, that player makes a legal choice.</li> 
      <li>If a player failed to draw cards, discard cards, or return cards from their hand to another zone, that player does so.</li> 
      <li>If an object is in an incorrect zone either due to a required zone change being missed or due to being put into the wrong zone during a zone change, the exact object is still known to all players, and it can be moved with only minor disruption to the current state of the game, put the object in the correct zone.</li> 
      <li>If damage assignment order has not been declared, the appropriate player chooses that order.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>
For each of these fixes, a simple backup may be performed beforehand if it makes applying the 
fix smoother. Triggered abilities are generated from these partial fixes only if they would have 
occurred had the action been taken at the correct time.
    </p>
    <p>
Otherwise, a full backup may be considered or the game state may be left as is.
    </p>
    <p>
If the game has proceeded past a point where an opponent could reasonably be expected to notice
the error, the opponent has also committed an infraction. In most cases, the infraction is Game 
Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State. However, if the judge believes that both players 
were responsible for the Game Rule Violation, such as due to the opponent controlling the
continuous effect modifying the rules of the game that led to the Game Rule Violation or a 
player taking action based on another player’s instruction, they have instead committed a Game 
Play Error — Game Rule Violation. For example, if a player casts Path to Exile on an 
opponent’s creature and the opponent puts the creature into the graveyard, once the game has 
continued both players will have committed a Game Rule Violation.

**2.5A Philosophy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, it is expected that **all players** are mindful of what is happening in the game.

**2.5B Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, if the judge believes that **more than one player** is responsible for the Game Rule Violation, such as due to the opponents controlling the continuous effect modifying the rules of the game that led to the Game Rule Violation or a player taking action based on another player’s instruction, then **all of the involved players** will have committed a Game Play Error - **Game Rule Violation**, where the **remaining players that were not involved** have commited a Game Play Error - **Failure to Maintain Game State**.

# 3. Tournament Errors

## 3.1. Tournament Error — Tardiness

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Game Loss</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
A player is not in their seat at the beginning of a round, or has not completed tasks assigned 
within the time allocated. If a round begins before the previous round would have ended (due to 
all players finishing early), tardiness does not apply until the scheduled end of the previous 
round.
    </p>
    <p>
If, before or during a match, a player requests and receives permission from a judge for a delay 
for a legitimate task, such as a bathroom break or finding replacements for missing cards, that 
player has up to 10 minutes to perform that task before they are considered tardy. If the player 
takes more than 10 minutes, a Match Loss will be applied. Otherwise, no penalty will be applied 
and a time extension given for the time taken.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>A player arrives to their seat 5 minutes after the round begins.</li>
      <li>A player hands in their decklist after the time designated by the judge or organizer.</li>
      <li>A player loses their deck and cannot find replacement cards within the first 10 minutes of the round.</li>
      <li>A player sits at an incorrect table and plays the wrong opponent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
Players are responsible for being on time and in the correct seat for their matches, and for 
completing registrations in a timely manner. The Tournament Organizer may announce that they 
are giving the players some additional time before a penalty is issued. Otherwise, the penalty is 
issued as soon as the round begins.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
The players are given a time extension corresponding to the length of the tardiness. 
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Upgrade</strong>: A player not in their seat 10 minutes into the round will receive a Match Loss and will 
be dropped from the tournament unless they report to the Head Judge or Scorekeeper before the 
end of the round.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Downgrade</strong>: A player who arrives at their seat before 1 minute has elapsed in the round receives 
a Warning.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**3.1A. Penalty** In Multiplayer Tournaments, **no Game Loss** is awarded for Tardiness. Instead, players who arrive late and would normally receive a Game Loss **skip their first turn**. For more information on skipping turns, refer to Comprehensive Rules 500.10. There is still the path for upgrade to Match Loss after 10 minutes, and the path for downgrade to Warning before 1 minute.

## 3.2. Tournament Error — Outside Assistance

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Match Loss</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
A player, spectator, or other tournament participant does any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seeks play advice or private information about their match from others once they have sat 
for their match.</li>
      <li>Gives play advice or reveals private information to players who have sat for their match. </li>
      <li>During a game, refers to notes (other than Oracle™ pages) made before the official 
beginning of the current match.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
These criteria also apply to any deck construction and draft portions of a limited tournament. 
Additionally, no notes of any kind may be made during a draft. Some team formats have 
additional communication rules that may modify the definition of this infraction.
    </p>
    <p>
Notes made outside the current match may only be referenced between games, and must have 
been in the player’s possession since the beginning of the match.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">  
      <li>During a game, a player references play notes that were created before the tournament.</li>
      <li>A spectator points out the correct play to a player who had not solicited the information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
Tournaments test the skill of a player, not their ability to follow external advice or directions. 
Any strategy advice, play advice, or construction advice from an external source is considered 
outside assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
Visual modifications to cards, including brief text, that provide minor strategic information or 
hints are acceptable and not considered notes. Detailed instructions or complex strategic advice 
may not be written on cards. The Head Judge is the final arbiter on what cards and notes are 
acceptable for a tournament. Spectators who commit this infraction may be asked to leave the 
venue if they are not enrolled in the tournament.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Downgrade</strong>: If the information acquired is information that the player would have access to 
between games, the penalty is a Game Loss.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**3.2A. Definition** In Multiplayer Tournaments, this refers **only to players outside of the current match**. Players who offer advice or strategic lines of play to opponents within their current match have not committed Outside Assistance. Keep in mind that **players that got eliminated count as spectators**, so while eliminated, they are considered outside of the current match.

## 3.3 Tournament Error — Slow Play

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Warning</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
A player takes longer than is reasonably required to complete game actions. If a judge believes a 
player is intentionally playing slowly to take advantage of a time limit, the infraction is 
Unsporting Conduct — Stalling.
    </p>
    <p>
It is also slow play if a player continues to execute a loop without being able to provide an exact 
number of iterations and the expected resulting game state.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>A player repeatedly reviews their opponent’s graveyard without any significant change in 
game state.</li>
      <li>A player spends time writing down the contents of an opponent’s library while resolving 
Thought Hemorrhage.</li>
      <li>A player takes an excessive amount of time to shuffle their deck between games.</li>
      <li>A player gets up from their seat to look at standings or goes to the bathroom without 
permission of an official.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
All players have the responsibility to play quickly enough so that their opponents are not at a 
significant disadvantage because of the time limit. A player may be playing slowly without 
realizing it. A comment of “I need you to play faster” is often appropriate and all that is needed. 
Further slow play should be penalized.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
In the event that the match exceeds the time limit, two additional turns are added to the number 
of additional turns played. This turn extension occurs before any end-of-match procedure can 
begin and after any time extensions that may have been issued. 
No additional turns are awarded if the match is already in additional turns, though the Warning 
still applies.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**3.3A. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, no **additional extra turns** are added as a remedy for slow play. Players who receive a Slow Play warning during the round will **skip any extra turns** originating from the End-of-Round procedure. Their turn is not considered when determining extra turns for end of round procedure. The remaining players take their extra turns. 

**3.3B. Additional Remedy** If a player is issued a Warning for **Slow Play after time in the round** has been called in Multiplayer Tournaments, that player's turn(s) originating from the End-of-Round procedure are **not skipped**, though the Warning still applies. 

## 3.5. Tournament Error — Deck Problem

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Warning</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
The contents of a deck or sideboard do not match the decklist registered and the decklist 
represents what the player intended to play.
    </p>
    <p>
If there are extra cards stored with the sideboard that could conceivably be played in the player’s 
deck, they will be considered a part of the sideboard unless they are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Promotional cards that have been handed out as part of the event.</li>
      <li>Double-faced cards represented by substitute cards in the deck.</li>
      <li>Damaged cards that have been officially proxied for the tournament.</li>
      <li>Double-faced cards being used to represent the back side of cards in the deck. These 
cards must not be sleeved in the same way as cards in the main deck and/or sideboard. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
Cards in different sleeves, tokens, and double-faced cards for which substitute cards are being 
used are ignored when determining deck (not sideboard) legality. 
    </p>
    <p>
If a player is unable to locate cards (or identical equivalents) from their main deck, treat it as a 
Decklist Problem instead. If sideboard cards are missing, make a note of this, but issue no 
penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
The discovery of a card that violates a companion restriction is a Deck Problem if the player 
does not wish to modify their decklist to accommodate the companion restriction.
</p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>A player has 59 cards in their deck, but 60 listed on their decklist.</li>
      <li>A player has a Pacifism in their deck from a previous opponent.</li>
      <li>In game one of a match, A player has Pithing Needle in their deck, but only has one 
registered in their sideboard.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
Players are expected to call attention to deck errors immediately, and not gain any potential 
advantage from having the cards in their deck.
    </p>
    <p>
The most common forms of deck error are failure to desideboard and having a card in the wrong 
deck. Both of these are difficult to gain advantage from without obvious cheating. Allowing the 
opponent to choose which card they would otherwise be working with is sufficient to 
compensate for the easily discovered situations. Duplicates of cards that begin in the main deck 
are more problematic, as they are not as easy to realize and catch, and thus mandate an upgraded 
penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
A window in which the error is a Game Loss is necessary to discourage intentional abuse of the 
minimum number of cards in the deck. Once that point has passed, the opponent agrees that the 
deck is valid. Judges should always be mindful of the abuse possibilities when investigating 
these infractions.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
        </p>
    <p>
Locate any cards missing from the deck and any incorrect cards in any game zone. Reveal those 
cards to the opponent. If the game has started, the opponent chooses whether to fix the problem 
now or when a player would next get priority, and which of the missing cards replaces each 
incorrect card; any extras are shuffled into the random portion of the library. If more cards are 
being removed than added, prioritize ones not in the library first. If there are still additional cards 
not in the library that need replacing, they are replaced by cards from the random portion of the
library. If the missing card(s) are with the sideboard and it isn’t the first game, choose the ones to 
be returned to the deck at random from main deck cards in the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
If the error caused a violation of a companion restriction and it is a post-sideboard game (or a 
pre-sideboard game and the player has elected to continue with the deck they registered that does 
not match the revealed companion condition), locate all cards violating the restriction. Then, 
choose that number of cards at random from unrevealed cards in the sideboard that meet the 
companion restriction. The opponent decides which chosen card replaces each illegal card. If 
making the deck match the companion condition is impossible, upgrade the penalty to a Game 
Loss.
    </p>
    <p>
If the missing card(s) were in a previous or current opponent’s deck, issue penalties to both 
players.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Upgrade</strong>: While presented to the opponent for pre-game shuffling or during a deckcheck, if it is 
discovered that a deck contains an invalid number of cards (and any missing cards are not in the 
opponent’s deck) or a sideboard contains too many cards, the penalty is a Game Loss.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Upgrade</strong>: If an opponent may have made strategic decisions based on the presence of a 
sideboard card (such as having seen it in the hand or library during a search effect), the penalty is 
a Game Loss.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Upgrade</strong>: If an error resulted in more copies of a main deck card being played than were 
registered or allowed by companion restriction and this was discovered after the game had 
begun, the penalty is a Game Loss unless all copies of the card are still in the random portion of 
the library. For example if the decklist has two copies of Shock in the main deck and two in the 
sideboard, but a search finds two copies of Shock in the library with another already in the 
graveyard, the penalty is upgraded.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**3.5A. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, the **located card or cards are revealed to all opponents**. The **majority of opponents** must come to a decision on wether to fix the problem now or when a player would next get priority, and which missing cards replaces each incorrect card. If no majority decision is reached, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent.

**3.5A. Note** In Multiplayer Tournaments, Judges and Players must be on the lookout for situations where the Player that committed the infraction is benefiting from the opponent's decision, which in some corner cases can be a sign of collusion and / or cheating. Keep in mind that given the nuances of multiplayer, sometimes opponents will legitimately choose an option that benefits the Player that committed the infraction.

**3.5B. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, it's possible for multiple cards to be missing by be located in multiple players' decks. If the missing card(s) were in a previous or current opponent’s deck(s), issue **penalties to all involved players**.

# 4. Unsporting Conduct

## 4.1. Unsporting Conduct — Minor

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Warning</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A player takes action that is disruptive to the tournament or its participants. It may affect the 
      comfort level of those around the individual, but determining whether this is the case is not 
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>A player uses excessively vulgar and profane language.</li>
      <li>A player inappropriately demands to a judge that their opponent receive a penalty.</li>
      <li>A player appeals to the Head Judge before waiting for the floor judge to issue a ruling.</li>
      <li>A player throws their deck on the ground after losing a game.</li>
      <li>A player leaves excessive trash in the play area after leaving the table.</li>
      <li>A player fails to follow the request of a tournament official to leave the play area.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      All participants should expect a safe and enjoyable environment at a tournament, and a player 
      needs to be made aware if their behavior is unacceptable so that this environment may be 
      maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The player must correct the problem immediately. Subsequent Unsporting Conduct — Minor 
      infractions, even for different offenses, will result in a Game Loss. If a Game Loss is issued for 
      repeated infractions, and it occurs at the end of a game, it is acceptable for the judge to apply the 
      penalty to the next game instead.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**4.2A. Examples** 

1. In a Multiplayer Tournament, a player uses coercive language to convince an opponent into intentionally drawing the game by saying "You either agree to draw or we lose the game to them".
2. In a Multiplayer Tournament, a player coerces and opponent into performing an action so they get priority back by saying "Tap that land for mana so I get priority back, otherwise we lose the game". 

## 4.2. Unsporting Conduct — Major

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Match Loss</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
A player takes action towards one or more individuals that could reasonably be expected to 
create a feeling of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked. This may include insults based 
on race, color, religion, national origin, age, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. Threats of 
physical violence should be treated as Unsporting Conduct – Aggressive Behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
It is possible for an offender to commit this infraction without intending malice or harm to the 
subject of the harassment. 
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A player uses a racial slur against their opponent.</li>
      <li>A player intentionally misgenders their opponent.</li>
      <li>A player takes inappropriate photos of another player without express permission.</li>
      <li>A player asks a spectator for a date, is denied, and continues to press the issue.</li>
      <li>A player purposefully obstructs another player with the intent of inducing physical 
contact.</li>
      <li>A spectator uses social media to bully another player.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
A safe environment is a basic expectation of any tournament attendee. Harassment undermines 
the safety and integrity of a tournament. Players who purposefully create harmful or 
unwelcoming situations in a tournament are expected to immediately correct the behavior and 
demonstrate remorse or be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
Because of the confrontational nature of this infraction, judges need to end any match in progress 
and separate the players. Care should be taken not to escalate the situation if at all possible. The 
offender will be removed from the area to receive the penalty, and education about why the 
behavior is unacceptable regardless of excuse. They may need a few moments to cool down
afterwards. Apologizing is encouraged, but the desire of the other individuals to not interact with 
their harasser must be respected.
    </p>
    <p>
Officials must investigate these matters as soon as they are brought to their attention. If they 
determine that the infraction does not meet the criteria for Unsporting Conduct – Major, it is still 
recommended that the players be talked to to avoid future misunderstandings.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
The player must correct the behavior immediately. If the offense occurs at the end of a match, it 
is acceptable for the judge to apply the penalty to the next match instead.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Upgrade</strong>: If the offense was committed with malicious intent, the player displays no remorse, or 
the offense is repeated at a later time, the penalty is Disqualification and removal from the venue
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions** 

**4.2A. Definition** In Multiplayer Tournaments, Colluding with an opponent is also an Unsporting Conduct - Major infraction.

**4.2B. Definition** In Multiplayer Tournaments, performing a Spite Play against an opponent is also an Unsporting Conduct - Major infraction.

**4.2C. Philosophy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, only the players instigating or perpetuating confrontation are removed from the match, in which case the **match can continue with the remaining players**.

**4.2D. Upgrade**: In Multiplayer Tournaments, if it is determined that players in Collusion with each other were aware that what they were doing was not permitted, or they acted with malicious intent, the penalty is Disqualification. All players found in Collusion receive this penalty.

**4.2D. Upgrade**: In Multiplayer Tournaments, if it is determined that a player performed a Spite Play while aware it was not permitted, or they acted with malicios intent, the penalty is Disqualification.

## 4.4. Unsporting Conduct — Bribery and Wagering

<details markdown="0">
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Match Loss</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
A player offers an incentive to entice an opponent into conceding, drawing, or changing the 
results of a match, encourages such an offer, or accepts such an offer. Refer to section 5.2 of the 
Magic Tournament Rules for a more detailed description of what constitutes bribery.
    </p>
    <p>
Wagering occurs when a player or spectator at a tournament places or offers to place a bet on the 
outcome of a tournament, match or any portion of a tournament or match. The wager does not 
need to be monetary, nor is it relevant if a player is not betting on their own match.
    </p>
    <p>
If the player was aware that what they were doing was against the rules, the infraction is 
Unsporting Conduct — Cheating.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A player in a Swiss round offers their opponent $100 to concede the match.</li>
      <li>A player offers their opponent a card in exchange for a draw.</li>
      <li>A player asks for a concession in exchange for a prize split.</li>
      <li>Two players agree that the winner of the match will be able to choose a rare card out of 
the other person’s deck after the match.</li>
      <li>Two spectators place a bet on the number of games that will be needed to decide a match.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
Bribery and wagering disrupt the integrity of the tournament and are strictly forbidden.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**4.4A. Philosophy** In Multiplayer Tournaments, **in-game agreements**, such as offering to not attack one another, are **not Bribery**. Bribery refers to tangible, monetary, or other similar means outside of the game offered to influence or change gameplay decisions or match outcome.
