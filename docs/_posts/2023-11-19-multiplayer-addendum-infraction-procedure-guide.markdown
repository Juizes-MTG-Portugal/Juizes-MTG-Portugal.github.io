# Introduction

The Multiplayer Addendum to the Infraction Procedure Guide exists to assist Judges who are working at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level in Multiplayer game mode tournaments. This document is written as a supplement to the Infraction Procedure Guide and should be used in close conjunction with it and the Multiplayer Addendum to the Magic Tournament Rules. 

This document is an extension of the Infraction Procedure Guide, and therefore a person using the Multiplayer Addendum should first be familiar with that document. Once a person has reviewed the relevant sections of the Infraction Procedure Guide, they can turn to the Multiplayer Addendum to the Infraction Procedure Guide to find details on how to proceed in Multiplayer Game Mode.

## Framework

Each section within this document mirrors its namesake in the Infraction Procedure Guide. Within each section, **Policy Additions** and **Edits** can be found. **Policy Additions** are policies outlined as best practice for handling infractions, penalties, and fixes. **Edits** are designed to address the few important removals or additions to this document that differ from the Infraction Procedure Guide. Items or sections with italicized text are taken directly from the Infraction Procedure Guide.

See the **Multiplayer Supplemental Tournament Rules** for further definitions of terms in this document. 

At the time of original publishing, this document has been published solely in English. If such a time exists that this document be printed, translated, or otherwise ported to another language, tournament participants must refer to the English version to settle disputes concerning interpretations.

This document is updated periodically. Please obtain the most current version [here](https://github.com/MonarchDevelopment/MIPG-and-MSTR/blob/main/MSIPG.md).

# 1. General Philosophy

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
Judges are neutral arbiters and enforcers of policy and rules. A judge shouldn’t intervene in a 
game unless they believe a rules violation has occurred, a player with a concern or question 
requests assistance, or the judge wishes to prevent a situation from escalating. Judges don’t stop 
play errors from occurring, but instead deal with errors that have occurred, penalize those who 
violate rules or policy, and promote fair play and sporting conduct by example and diplomacy. 
Judges may intervene to prevent or preempt errors occurring outside of a game. Knowledge of a 
player’s history or skill does not alter an infraction, but it may be taken into account during an 
investigation.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of a penalty is to educate the player not to make similar mistakes in the future. This 
is done through both an explanation of where the rules or policies were violated and a penalty to 
reinforce the education. Penalties are also for the deterrence and education of every other player 
in the event and are also used to track player behavior over time.
</p>
<p>
If a minor violation is quickly handled by the players to their mutual satisfaction, a judge does 
not need to intervene. If the players are playing in a way that is clear to both players, but might 
cause confusion to an external observer, judges are encouraged to request that the players make 
the situation clear, but not assess an infraction or issue any penalty. In both these situations, the 
judge should ensure that the game progresses normally. More significant violations are addressed 
by first identifying what infraction applies, then proceeding with the corresponding instructions.
</p>
<p>
Only the Head Judge is authorized to issue penalties that deviate from these guidelines. The 
Head Judge may not deviate from this guide’s procedures except in significant and exceptional 
circumstances or a situation that has no applicable philosophy for guidance. Significant and 
exceptional circumstances are rare - a table collapses, a draft booster contains cards from a 
different set, etc. The Rules Enforcement Level, round of the tournament, age or experience-level of the player, desire to educate the player, and certification level of the judge are NOT 
exceptional circumstances. If another judge feels deviation is appropriate, they must consult with 
the Head Judge.
</p>
<p>
Judges are human and make mistakes. When a judge makes a mistake, they should acknowledge 
the mistake, apologize to the players, and fix it if it is not too late. If a member of the tournament 
staff gives a player erroneous information that causes them to commit a violation, the Head 
Judge is authorized to downgrade the penalty. For example, a player asks a judge whether a card 
is legal for a format and is told yes. When that player’s deck is found to be illegal because of 
these cards, the Head Judge applies the normal procedure for fixing the decklist, but may 
downgrade the penalty to a Warning because of the direct error of the judge. If a player clearly 
acts on erroneous information provided by a judge during the game, the Head Judge may 
consider a backup to the point of the action taken, even if that action did not lead to a violation.
    </p>

**Policy Additions**

**1A.** In Multiplayer formats, due to larger match sizes and longer match lengths, the number of games played is typically one. As such, the penalty of Game Loss is effectively equivalent to the penalty of Match Loss. The application of Game Loss has been modified where appropriate. 

**1B.** In some cases, the penalty of Game Loss remains. In other cases, a new remedy and penalty have been substituted to maintain the philosophy of the Infraction Procedure Guide when the application of a Game Loss has been deemed too severe or otherwise inappropriate.

## 1.1. Definition of Penalties

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
<strong>Warning</strong>
</p>
<p>
Warnings are used in situations of incorrect play when a small amount of time is needed to 
implement the corrective procedure. The purpose of a Warning is to alert judges and players 
involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a permanent record of the infraction. A time 
extension should be issued if the ruling has taken more than a minute.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Game Loss</strong>
</p>
<p>
A Game Loss ends the current game immediately and the player who committed the infraction is 
considered to have lost the game for the purpose of match reporting. The player receiving a 
Game Loss chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of that match, if applicable. If a 
Game Loss is issued before the match begins, neither player in that match may use sideboards (if 
the tournament uses them) for the first game they play. 
</p>
<p>
Game Losses are applied immediately if the game is still ongoing, or to the player’s next game if 
it is not, unless otherwise specified. If a player would receive multiple Game Losses at the same 
time, they only receive one. If simultaneous Game Loss penalties are issued to each player, they 
are recorded, but do not affect the match score. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Match Loss</strong>
</p>
<p>
A Match Loss is a severe penalty that is usually issued when the match itself has been 
compromised. 
</p>
<p>
Match Losses are applied to the match during which the offense occurred unless the offender’s 
match has already ended, in which case the penalty will be applied to that player’s next match. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disqualification</strong>
</p>
<p>
A Disqualification is issued for activity that damages the integrity of a tournament as a whole or 
for severe unsporting conduct. 
</p>
<p>
The recipient of a Disqualification does not need to be a player in the tournament. They may be a 
spectator or other bystander. 
</p>
<p>
Disqualification can occur without proof of action so long as the Head Judge determines 
sufficient information exists to believe the tournament’s integrity may have been compromised. 
It is recommended that the Head Judge’s report reflect this fact.
</p>
<p>
When this penalty is applied, the player loses their current match and is dropped from the 
tournament. If a player has already received prizes at the time they are disqualified, that player 
may keep those prizes but does not receive any additional prizes or awards they may be due. 
</p>
<p>
When a player is disqualified during a tournament, they are removed from the tournament and do 
not take up a place in the standings. This means that all players in the tournament will advance 
one spot in the standings and are entitled to any prizes the new standing would offer. If the 
Disqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional players advance in place of the 
disqualified player although they do move up a spot in the standings. For example, if a player is 
disqualified during the quarterfinal round of a Magic Tabletop Mythic Qualifier, the former 9th 
place finisher does not advance into the single elimination top 8, but they do move into 8th place 
in the standings. 
</p>
<p>
Disqualifications should be reported <a href="https://askwpn-na.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001446253">here</a>. Please include the Wizards Account email address of 
the disqualified player and that player’s opponent.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**1.1A.** In best-of-one Multiplayer game mode a Game Loss penalty would be equivalent to a Match Loss. Therefore, each penalty where a Game Loss would be applied has been updated while maintaining the purposes of mitigating advantages and disincentivizing the infraction. 

## 1.3. Randomizing a Library

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
The remedy for some infractions in this document includes shuffling the randomized portion of 
the library. This requires first determining whether any portion of the library is non-random, such 
as cards that have been manipulated on the top or bottom of the library, and separating those. 
Check with both players to verify this, and check the graveyard, exile, and battlefield for library 
manipulation cards, such as Brainstorm and cards with the scry mechanic. Once the library has 
been shuffled, any manipulated cards are returned to their correct locations.
</p>
<p>
Shuffles performed by a judge as part of a remedy are not considered shuffles for game purposes.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**1.3A.** In Multiplayer game mode, check with all players when determining and verifying wheter any portion of a library is non-random.

# 2. Game Play Errors

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
Game Play Errors are caused by incorrect or inaccurate play of the game such that it results in 
violations of the <strong>Magic</strong> Comprehensive Rules. Many offenses fit into this category and it would 
be impossible to list them all. The guide below is designed to give judges a framework for 
assessing how to handle a Game Play Error.
</p>
<p>
Most Game Play Error infractions are assumed to have been committed unintentionally. If the 
judge believes that the error was intentional, they should first consider whether an Unsporting 
Conduct — Cheating infraction has occurred. 
</p>
<p>
With the exception of Failure to Maintain Game State, which is never upgraded, the third or 
subsequent Warning for a Game Play Error offense in the same category is upgraded to a Game 
Loss. For multi-day tournaments, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2A.** In Multiplayer game mode, the third infraction is often not worthy of a Match Loss. It is still important, however, to discourage the infraction and mitigate the possible gained avantage. In Multiplayer game mode, only the **fourth and subsequent Warnings** for a Game Play Error in the same category, for the **Missed Trigger, Looking at Extra Cards, Mulligan Procedure Error and Game Rule Violation** categories are upgraded to a Game Loss.

## 2.1. Game Play Error — Missed Trigger

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">No Penalty</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A triggered ability triggers, but the player controlling the ability doesn’t demonstrate awareness 
      of the trigger’s existence by the first time that it would affect the game in a visible fashion.
      The point by which the player needs to demonstrate this awareness depends on the impact that 
      the trigger would have on the game:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that requires its controller to choose targets (other than 'target opponent'), modes, or other choices made when the ability is put onto the stack</strong>: The controller must announce those choices before they next pass priority.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that causes a change in the visible game state (including life 
        totals) or requires a choice upon resolution</strong>: The controller must take the appropriate 
        physical action or acknowledge the specific trigger before taking any game actions (such 
        as casting a sorcery spell or explicitly taking an action in the next step or phase) that can 
        be taken only after the triggered ability should have resolved. Note that passing priority, 
        casting an instant spell or activating an ability doesn’t mean a triggered ability has been 
        forgotten, as it could still be on the stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that changes the rules of the game</strong>: The controller must 
        acknowledge the trigger or stop an opponent who tries to take any resulting illegal action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways</strong>: The controller 
        must make the change known by the first time the change has an effect on the visible 
        game state.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once any of the above obligations has been fulfilled, further problems are treated as a Game Play 
      Error — Game Rule Violation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triggered abilities that do nothing except create delayed triggered abilities automatically resolve 
      without requiring acknowledgment. Awareness of the resulting delayed trigger must be 
      demonstrated at the appropriate point. Triggered abilities that do nothing except create one or 
      more copies of a spell or ability (such as storm or cipher) automatically resolve, but awareness of 
      the resulting objects must be demonstrated using the same requirements as described above 
      (even though the objects may not be triggered abilities).
    </p>
    <p>
      Abilities consisting of an action followed by “when you do” in the same ability are considered 
      communicated by the announcement of the action. This is most commonly the case for exert and 
      similar abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a triggered ability would have no impact on the game, it’s not an infraction to fail to 
      demonstrate awareness of it. For example, if the effect of a triggered ability instructs its 
      controller to sacrifice a creature, a player who controls no creatures isn’t required to demonstrate 
      awareness of the ability. Similarly, a player demonstrating awareness of an optional trigger with 
      no visible effect is assumed to have made the affirmative choice unless the opponent responds.
      Judges do not intervene in a missed trigger situation unless they intend to issue a Warning or 
      have reason to suspect that the controller is intentionally missing their triggered abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      A player controlling another player is responsible for that player’s triggers in addition to their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        Knight of Infamy (a 2/1 creature with exalted) attacks alone. Its controller says “Take 
        two.”
      </li>
      <li>
        A player forgets to remove the final time counter from a suspended spell and then draws 
        a card during their draw step.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player casts Manic Vandal, then forgets its triggered ability by not choosing a target for 
        it. They realize this only after casting another spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player forgets to exile the Angel token created by Geist of Saint Traft at end of combat. 
        They realize the error when declaring blockers during the next turn.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be harshly penalized when 
      forgetting about one. Players are expected to remember their own triggered abilities; 
      intentionally ignoring one may be Unsporting Conduct — Cheating (unless the ability would 
      have no impact on the game as described above). Even if an opponent is involved in the 
      announcement or resolution of the ability, the controller is still responsible for ensuring the 
      opponents make the appropriate choices and take the appropriate actions. Opponents are not 
      required to point out triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may do so if they 
      wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise indicated, and the impact on 
      the game state may not be immediately apparent. The opponent’s benefit is in not having to point 
      out triggered abilities, although this does not mean that they can cause triggers to be missed. If 
      an opponent requires information about the precise timing of a triggered ability or needs details 
      about a game object that may be affected by a resolved triggered ability, that player may need to 
      acknowledge that ability’s existence before its controller does. A player who makes a play that 
      may or may not be legal depending on whether an opponent’s uncommunicated trigger has been 
      remembered has not committed an infraction; their play either succeeds, confirming that the 
      trigger has been missed, or is rewound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to be missed by taking game 
      actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game. During an opponent’s turn, if a trigger’s 
      controller demonstrates awareness of the trigger before they take an active role (such as taking 
      an action or explicitly passing priority), the trigger is remembered. The Out-of-Order Sequencing 
      rules (MTR section 4.3) may also be applicable, especially as they relate to batches of actions or 
      resolving items on the stack in an improper order.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the triggered ability is an enters-the-battlefield trigger of an Aura that affects only the 
      enchanted permanent and causes a visible change to that permanent, resolve the ability 
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the triggered ability is a delayed triggered ability that undoes a zone change (including token 
      creation) caused by the effect that created the delayed triggered ability, the opponent chooses 
      whether to resolve the ability the next time a player would get priority or when a player would 
      get priority at the start of the next phase. The new zone does not need to be the same as the one 
      the card was originally moved from.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all other triggered abilities, if the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous 
      turn, instruct the players to continue playing. If the triggered ability created an effect whose 
      duration has already expired, instruct the players to continue playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the triggered ability isn’t covered by the previous paragraphs, the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack. If it is, it’s inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if possible or on the bottom of the stack. No player may make choices for the triggered ability involving objects that would not have been legal choices when the ability should have triggered. For example, if the ability instructs a player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the player is in the process of, or has just completed, an action that indicates the trigger has 
      been missed, and completing that action would change the effect of the trigger, a simple backup 
      may be performed on that action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Upgrade:</strong> If the triggered ability is usually considered detrimental for the controlling player and 
      they own the card responsible for the existence of the trigger, the penalty is a Warning. The 
      current game state is not a factor in determining this, though symmetrical abilities (such as 
      Howling Mine) may be considered usually detrimental or not depending on who is being 
      affected.
    </p>

<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.1A. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer game mode, since there are multiple opponents, the decisions that would be made by "the opponent", are instead made by a majority vote by the opponents. If no majority decision is reached (perhaps because one opponent was eliminated and there is an even number of opponents), the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent.

**2.1B. Upgrade** In Multiplayer game mode, this infraction only upgrades to Game Loss after the forth and subsequent ones.

## 2.3. Game Play Error — Hidden Card Error

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original policy</strong></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="float:right; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px 15px;">Warning</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
A player commits an error in the game that cannot be corrected by only publicly available 
information. It is not a Hidden Card Error if the opponent acknowledges the action or controls 
the continuous effect modifying the game rule that made the action illegal. This infraction only 
applies when a card whose identity is known to only one player is in a hidden set of cards both 
before and after the error.
    </p>
    <p>
If an additional card is seen but not added to the set, the infraction is Game Play Error —
Looking at Extra Cards.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        A player draws four cards after casting Ancestral Recall.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player scries two cards when they should only have scried one.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player resolves a Dark Confidant trigger, but forgets to reveal the card before putting it into their hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player has more cards in their hand than can be accounted for.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player casts Anticipate and picks up the top four cards of their library.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player, going first, draws for their turn.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
<strong>Philosophy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
Though the game state cannot be reversed to the ‘correct’ state, this error can be mitigated by 
giving the opponent sufficient knowledge and ability to offset the error so that it is less likely to 
generate advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
If cards are placed into a public zone, then their order is known and the infraction can be handled 
as a Game Rule Violation. Order cannot be determined from card faces only visible to one player 
unless the card is in a uniquely identifiable position (such as on top of the library, or as the only 
card in hand.)
    </p>
    <p>
Be careful not to apply this infraction in situations where a publicly-correctable error 
subsequently leads to an uncorrectable situation such as a Brainstorm cast using green mana. In 
these situations, the infraction is based on that root cause.
    </p>
    <p>
Information about cards previously known by the opponent, such as cards previously revealed 
while on the top of the library or by a previous look at the hand, may be taken into account while 
determining the set of cards to which the remedy applies.
    </p>
    <p>
Always operate on the smallest set possible to remedy the error. This may mean applying the 
remedy to only part of a set defined by an instruction. For example, if a player resolves Collected 
Company, picks up three cards with one hand and then four cards with the other, the last drawn 
set of four cards should be used for the remedy, instead of the full set of seven cards.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
In cases where the infraction was immediately followed by moving a card from the affected set 
to a known location, such as by discarding, putting cards on top of the library, or playing a land, 
a simple backup to the point just after the error may be performed.
    </p>
    <p>
If the set of cards that contained the problem no longer exists, there is no remedy to be applied.
    </p>
    <p>
If the error put cards into a set prematurely and other operations involving cards in the set should 
have been performed first, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and their
opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards. Put those cards aside until the point at 
which they should have been legally added, then return them to the set.
    </p>
    <p>
If the error involves one or more cards that were supposed to be revealed, the player reveals the 
set of cards that contains the unrevealed cards and their opponent chooses that many previously-unknown cards. Treat those as the cards that were ‘revealed’ and return them to the set that was 
being selected from; the player then reperforms the action. If recreating the original selection set 
and reperforming the action would be too disruptive, leave the selected cards in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
If a set affected by the error contains more cards than it is supposed to contain, the player reveals 
the set of cards that contains the excess and their opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards sufficient to reduce the set to the correct size. These excess cards are returned to 
the correct location. If that location is the library, they should be shuffled into the random portion
unless the owner previously knew the identity of the card/cards illegally moved; that many cards, 
chosen by the opponent, are returned to the original location instead. For example, if a player 
playing with Sphinx of Jwar Isle illegally draws a card, that card should be returned to the top of 
the library.
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Upgrade</strong>: If a face-down card cast using a morph ability is discovered during the game to not 
have a morph ability, the penalty is a Game Loss. If the player has one or more cards with a 
morph ability in hand, has not added previously unknown cards to their hand since casting the 
card found in violation, and has discovered the error themselves, the upgrade does not apply and 
they may swap the card for a card with the morph ability in hand.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</details>
<p></p>

**Policy Additions**

**2.3A Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer game mode, the decision on what cards must be returned, majority of remaining opponents must decide on the card(s) returned. If no majority decision is reached, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent. 

## 2.5. Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation

While Game Rule Violations can be attributed to one player, they usually occur publicly and 
both players are expected to be mindful of what is happening in the game. It is tempting to try 
and “fix” these errors, but it is important that they be handled consistently, regardless of their 
impact on the game.

      <strong>Additional Remedy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
First, consider a simple backup (see section 1.4).
    </p>
    <p>
If a simple backup is not sufficient and the infraction falls into one or more of the following 
categories, and only into those categories, perform the appropriate partial fix:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a player forgot to untap one or more permanents at the start of their turn and it is still the same turn, untap them.</li> 
      <li>If a player made an illegal choice (including no choice where required) for a static ability generating a continuous effect still on the battlefield, that player makes a legal choice.</li> 
      <li>If a player failed to draw cards, discard cards, or return cards from their hand to another zone, that player does so.</li> 
      <li>If an object is in an incorrect zone either due to a required zone change being missed or due to being put into the wrong zone during a zone change, the exact object is still known to all players, and it can be moved with only minor disruption to the current state of the game, put the object in the correct zone.</li> 
      <li>If damage assignment order has not been declared, the appropriate player chooses that order.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>
For each of these fixes, a simple backup may be performed beforehand if it makes applying the 
fix smoother. Triggered abilities are generated from these partial fixes only if they would have 
occurred had the action been taken at the correct time.
    </p>
    <p>
Otherwise, a full backup may be considered or the game state may be left as is.
    </p>
    <p>
If the game has proceeded past a point where an opponent could reasonably be expected to notice
the error, the opponent has also committed an infraction. In most cases, the infraction is Game 
Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State. However, if the judge believes that both players 
were responsible for the Game Rule Violation, such as due to the opponent controlling the
continuous effect modifying the rules of the game that led to the Game Rule Violation or a 
player taking action based on another player’s instruction, they have instead committed a Game 
Play Error — Game Rule Violation. For example, if a player casts Path to Exile on an 
opponent’s creature and the opponent puts the creature into the graveyard, once the game has 
continued both players will have committed a Game Rule Violation.

# 3. Tournament Errors

## 3.1. Tournament Error — Tardiness

**Policy Additions**

**3.1A. Penalty** In Multiplayer game mode, no Game Loss is awarded for Tardiness. Instead, players who arrive late and would normally receive a Game Loss skip their first turn. For more information on skipping turns, refer to Comprehensive Rules 500.10.

## 3.2. Tournament Error — Outside Assistance

**Policy Additions**

**3.2A. Definition** In Multiplayer game mode, this refers only to players outside of the current match. Players who offer advice or strategic lines of play to opponents within their current match have not committed Outside Assistance. Keep in mind that players that got eliminated count as spectators, so while eliminated, they are considered outside of the current match.

**3.2B. Downgrade** In Multiplayer games modes, if the penalty for Outside Assistance is downgraded, it downgrades to a Warning instead of a Game Loss. 

## 3.3 Tournament Error — Slow Play

**Policy Additions**

**3.3A. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer game mode, no additional extra turns are added as a remedy for slow play. Players who receive a Slow Play warning during the round will skip any extra turns originating from the End-of-Round procedure. Their turn is not considered when determining extra turns for end of round procedure. The remaining players take their extra turns. 

**3.3B. Additional Remedy** If a player is issued a Warning for Slow Play after time in the round has been called in Multiplayer game mode, that player's turn(s) originating from the End-of-Round procedure are not skipped, though the Warning still applies. 

## 3.5. Tournament Error — Deck Problem

**Policy Additions**

**3.5A. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer game mode, the card or cards are revealed to all opponents. The majority of opponents must come to a decision on which missing card replaces each incorrect card. If no majority decision is reached, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent.  

**3.5B. Additional Remedy** In Multiplayer game mode, it's possible for multiple cards to be missing by be located in multiple players' decks. If the missing card(s) were in a previous or current opponent’s deck(s), issue penalties to **all involved** players.

# 4. Unsporting Conduct

## 4.2. Unsporting Conduct — Major

**Policy Additions**

**4.2A. Philosophy** In Multiplayer game mode, only the players instigating or perpetuating confrontation are removed from the match.

## 4.4. Unsporting Conduct — Bribery and Wagering

**Policy Additions**

**4.4A. Philosophy** In Multiplayer game mode, in-game agreements, such as offering to not attack one another, are not Bribery. Bribery refers to tangible, monetary, or other similar means outside of the game offered to influence or change gameplay decisions or match outcome.
