The Multiplayer Addendum documents available here are open source tools meant for public use.

The goal of these documents is to provide a solid standard for Tournament Organizers and Judges across the world to run multiplayer Magic events successfully.

Everyone is free to suggest changes, and they will be analysed by experienced judges, in order to make sure the published version fits the tournament logistics needs in the best possible way.

If you have a suggestion, feel free to contact us via email, [opening an issue](https://github.com/Juizes-MTG-Portugal/Juizes-MTG-Portugal.github.io/issues) or even a pull request on github!
